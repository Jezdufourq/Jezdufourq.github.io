**DISCLAIMER: Excuse any spelling mistakes** Let‚Äôs start the first proper blog post off in chronological order. This post is quite long, and hopefully I can maintain the attention to detail in my later posts. However, I would not expect much, especially towards the later end of my semester in Germany (December). I will get around to where I am at currently, however I need to catch up on the past month of travel!

Scotland has some history in my family! My mum‚Äôs side of the family is Scottish, with my grandad‚Äôs last name being Davidson and my grandmothers being Hughes. So, it was only fitting that before I started my exchange program in Germany, I would visit the family in Scotland (Edinburgh) and London.

**01/09/19 ‚Äì 02/09/19:**
A 10pm (ish) flight from Brisbane to Edinburgh, with a stopover in Dubai. A total of 24 something hours of travel. I have never been on a long-haul flight, with the exception of when I went to the United Kingdom at the age of 3. Furthermore, I have not really experienced what real jet lag is like. So, as you can expect, I was not really prepared for the jet lag at all. My first day being in Scotland would attest to this, as I woke up early in the morning, and even slept/walked somewhat the first night I arrived. After doing this long-haul flight (and two more long haul flights a fortnight later), I can recommend two things. 1) The best seat on a plane is the middle aisle seat (the aisle seat in the 4-seat section on an airbus). This is because you can stretch your legs due to the aisle, and you only have 1 person next to you who will wake you up for the toilet. I was quite lucky with my flight because I was given the emergency exit seats for both of my flights. 2) wear comfortable clothes and bring noise cancelling headphones. I recommend hoodie and sweatpants. It is easier to fall off to sleep if you are comfortable, and with a hoodie you can use it as another layer of noise blocking. Also, noise cancelling earphones are a must, especially if it‚Äôs a loud flight.

**03/09/19:**
This was my first real day in Edinburgh after my flight. Still somewhat jetlagged (although in the morning I felt fine), I set off with my cousin Stephen to explore the city of Edinburgh. We started at the bottom of Arthur‚Äôs seat, an old volcanic plug towards the east side of Edinburgh. Although this mountain did not appear that tall, it was a solid 25-minute hike up to the top. Here we were greeted with a 360 degree view of Edinburgh from the forth road bridge, all the way to the North sea. Arthurs seat connects at the north side to the Queen‚Äôs gallery, and parliament of Scotland. In this area, there is the palace of Holyroadhouse. This palace is the place of residence for which the Queen stays in on her visits to Scotland.  We made our way down to this area, and then up high street (the royal mile) to Edinburgh castle. Although we did not go into Edinburgh castle, we did go down the backside to princess park to get a better view. Here, I took some really nice drone shots of the castle from Princess park. We looped back around past Waverly to the royal mile again to grab a pie and ale for lunch.

**04/09/19:**
The next day was somewhat similar, however instead of my cousin showing me around it was myself showing Georgia around. Georgia and I did not plan to be in Edinburgh at the same dates. It just happened to be that we were both in Edinburgh at the same time before we both begun our exchanges. What a coincidence! It was good to have a familiar face around (besides family of course) to do some sightseeing. I ended up meeting her at Waverly, before we went back up to the royal mile to get into Edinburgh castle. We both thought that we would leave Arthur‚Äôs seat until later in the afternoon, due to the weather. However, in classic Scottish form, the weather didn‚Äôt seem to be what it was forecasted as. Nevertheless, we went to Edinburgh castle and lined up to try and get in. I was not allowed in because I had my drone in my bag, so that idea was totally ditched. Luckily, Georgia had already been inside, and I didn‚Äôt really mind too much about missing out on the crown of jewels in the castle. Again, we ended up going down the back of Edinburgh castle to princess street gardens and grabbed a coffee from Costa. As a side note, Brisbane and Australia in general should adopt the business model of Costa and Pret‚Äôs in some aspect. Costa, and Prets are caf√© chains in the UK, which offer quick coffee and ready to go meals (more on this in my London blog post). After exploring the new town for a bit, we walked to the east side of Edinburgh to go up Carlton‚Äôs hill. Here you can get a nice view of the city looking over waverly station. There are also some monuments and a gallery which are quite visible from anywhere in Edinburgh. We both walked down Calton‚Äôs hill to climb Arthurs seat for the second time in two days. Funnily enough, Arthur‚Äôs seat did not change at all since the day before. However, Georgia had never seen it so we climbed, nevertheless. As we summited the top, we noticed a dark rain cloud approaching rapidly. It started pissing down rain as we were on the top of the mountain. Funny because 20 minutes ago it was sunny! The day ended back at Waverly, where we parted ways until a couple for days later for London. The day ended with Indian with Stephen, Aunty Catherine and Uncle Billy.

**05/09/19:**
Almost halfway through my time in Scotland, Aunt Dode arrived at Aunt Catherine‚Äôs to pick me up. I will be spending the next two nights at Aunt Dode‚Äôs in the Kingdom of Fife. The Kingdom of Fife is north of Edinburgh, across the North Sea. A kingdom or burrow in Scotland is a really large area which has a whole collection of smaller suburbs within it. We drove to North Berwick, which is to the east of Edinburgh. This location is important to the Davidson side of the family because it was used for holidays. It wouldn‚Äôt be a Scotland visit without trying fish and chips. We went to North Berwick fry to try the fish and chips there (which were the best fish and chips that I have ever had, sorry Doug‚Äôs)! On the drive back, we made a slight detour to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt Rosies holiday house in North Berwick. We then made the trip across the queen‚Äôs ferry crossing to Fife, where I set up home at Aunt Dode‚Äôs in Auchtertool. Here we went through some old family photos, before going over to Sally‚Äôs and Kevin‚Äôs to pick up the dog. The day finished with steak and veggies.

Friday, and the week in Scotland was almost over. In the morning, Aunt Dode and myself drove to Blackhall to see Joanne and the cousins. We went around to some of the Davidson locations in the morning (old houses which have been in the family for a while). After this, I was given a tour of some of the old bars around Edinburgh. One of these bars included the Roseburn bar, next to Murrayfield. Here we grabbed a pint of ale with Aunt Dode and Joanne. The scouting of Murrayfield was good preparation for the evening, where we would return to watch a rugby game between Scotland and Georgia. Before the game, we had dinner at an Italian in the city with Joanne, Allan, Aunt Dode, Sally and Kevin as well as Mary and Rosie. We then caught the tram to the game at Murrayfield. Scotland ended up thrashing Georgia, however I cannot remember the score. The highlight of the game was listening to the national anthem and seeing all of the Scotland supporters in kilts.

**07/09/19:**
Last day in Scotland (well second last before I caught the train to London, however I caught the train in the morning). In the morning we went to Queensferry to visit Ga and Gapa‚Äôs (Grandma and Grandpa‚Äôs) old house. I was also given the run down on a couple of family stories (great birth story Aunty Lin)! Some last-minute souvenir shopping in Edinburgh, and that was the end of my time with the Davidson side of the family. We bought some cakes and went back to Aunt Catherines. Stephen invited me to his mates 40th birthday (free beer and pizza). Was a good time to get out of Edinburgh and to have a couple of beers.

**08/09/19:**
And that was it, my last day in Edinburgh. I caught the train to London with Georgia. 4 hours later and I would be at Kings Cross. It was a great week, and I loved spending time with the extended family. Thanks heaps to Aunt Catherine, Uncle billy and Aunt Dode for hosting me for the week (as well as all the rest of the family who showed me around)!
