This blog post is going to be short and sweet, because the week consisted of settling into Karlsruhe, University as well as going for a day trip to Baden-Baden.

The week started with Maddy and I trying to sneak into the A2 class for German. To give you some context, both Maddy and myself are not supposed to be level A2 in German. We are both in A1.2, and I would say that we are borderline A1.2. The reason that we went into the A2 class is that we both thought that if we took a harder German level, it would force us to learn/catch up to the harder levels. This was far from the truth and was quite evident the moment we got into the class and the teacher started speaking fluent German thinking that we should understand it. Maddy wrote into google translate that she was not supposed to be in this class, but it would be good if the teacher could let us stay. It became apparent that we were not A2 level, when the teacher asked in German if Maddy had parents, and she said no.

The comedy of errors continued throughout the week, as myself, EJ and Maddy went to our first customer collaboration project meeting. Because we were the only English speaking students in this class, most of the class was run in German (except for the times when our group had to speak). We were put in a group with Florian and Yannik, two Germans from the area around Karlsruhe. This subject was one of the best decisions I made regarding my subject selections because it was quite similar to the IT capstone project at QUT. It is a great lead into the work which we will be doing at SAP because we learn how to work in a small team, as well as best practices from the industry (JIRA, git and agile). 

On Wednesday, I went to the europohaus bar which is open on Mittwoch (Wednesday). Each of the student dormitories in Karlsruhe have their own student bars down at the first level, or in the basement. In these bars you can get really cheap drinks, we are talking 1 euro for a shot, and 1.5 euro for a beer. The europohaus (europabar) is a really good student bar because it has a fussball table, and it is also around 4 other student dormitories. I learnt it was German culture to knock on the fussball table if you want to play next. On the way home, I grabbed a leberkÃ¤ssemmel from a german fast food place in marketplatz (no idea what the fast food place is called). A leberkÃ¤ssemmel translates to â€˜meat loaf in a rollâ€™. It has to be one of my favourite German food options because its cheap, easy and tastes really good. They put this big slice of meat in a roll, with some onions and sweet mustard. 

I lucked out on my university schedule. With classes only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I basically had Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday free to either travel or catch up on the University work. This weekend, we (EJ, Dani, Elise and Maddy) opted to go to Baden-Baden. Baden-Baden is a small town on the edge of the Black Forest. It is about a 30-minute drive from Karlsruhe. The city is a tourist destination due to it having thermal baths, and it being on the edge of the Black Forest.

So, we caught the S-Bahn from Karlsruhe to Baden-Baden, stopping at the train station and then catching a bus from the train station to the middle of the city. Another perk of being a student in Karlsruhe is the amount of support you get from the German government to study there. For example, each of the students are given free travel to the KVV transport network (which is basically a 30-minute radius around Karlsruhe â€“ Trams and S-Bahnâ€™s in Karlsruhe are included). This is such a great perk because it saved me roughly 180 euros (300 AUD), thanks Germany! However, I am digressing from the point.

Baden-Baden is a beautiful city because it is situated in the Black forest. So, as you can image, the scenery was mountainous with plenty of trees in sight. In addition to this, the season was Autumn (Fall in the northern hemisphere), so all of the trees were orange, red and yellow. The morning consisted of us wandering around the city and stopping past the hot springs (which are only really good during winter, maybe next time). For lunch we went to the LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u restaurant (trivial as Baden-Baden is in Baden-Wurttemberg, and LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u is from Bavaria). To add to this, I order SpÃ¤tzle which is actually from Baden-Wurttemberg. We ran into Emer (a friend from Ireland) outside of the restaurant coincidentally, after we finished out lunch.

After lunch, we walked to the bottom of the mountain close to Baden Baden where we caught the Merkur Funicular Railway to the top of the mountain. The views from the top of the mountain was amazing. It was interrupted after an angry German came and shouted at me for trying to fly my drone. Serves me right though because I was flying it in the same area where paragliders were jumping off the mountain. And that was it! The end of the Baden-Baden trip, I would explain the rest but itâ€™s not interesting (came down the mountain, caught the bus and then train back).

The week finished with the stadtfest in Karlsruhe (city fest), which is the festival of the City. It was really interesting because most of the stores are closed on Sunday in Germany, and there are no one in the streets. However, for the stadtfest, there were so many people in the streets (particularly KaiserstraÃŸe â€“ the main street in Karlsruhe). That night I went down the level 3 on my dorm and went out with the Americans and Italians to an American bar (la cage), because britt(American) asked for a bottle opener. The week finished on Monday where Maddy, Yannik and I went to the Oxford pub to have a schnitzel and campus ale. Campus ale is basically a mix of beer and cider, it is really good!

I said it would be short and sweet, however it probably was not that short. I need to try and keep these blogs short because I have heaps of content to write! Next week, Strasbourg and our first look at the SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
