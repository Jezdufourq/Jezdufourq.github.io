This week consisted of Strasbourg, walking around the SAP campus, and settling into university life. As per usual, I will try to keep it short. However, given my track record, I do not think this will be the case.

The first couple of days of the week consisted of settling into university life. As per the previous blog post, I have arranged my university days so that I have classes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (with Thursday being the day which I have the customer collaboration project to work on for the whole day). 

Tuesday, I had global economy, a class which goes through the history of economics and how business today interact on a global scale. This has to be my favourite class at the moment, partly because of my fascination with the economy. The smoke alarm went off in class in the morning, which was a scene especially when everyone was running around screaming in German and you had no clue what they were saying.

Wednesday, and Thursday were much of the same, as I had university both days. The key highlights were Maddy accidently stealing someoneâ€™s bike key, the aussies watching puberty blues one night, and exchanging German and Australian music with Florian and Yannick. 

Friday we (the aussies) all decided we would go out to Europabar to get out and meet some new people. EJ came over to my house and we preâ€™ed before going out. I think preeing got to EJ, with him sculling a full bottle of wine, only to skull another bottle of wine at Europabar, and then throwing up in the toilet. At Europabar, I ran into a girl from England who used to live in Redcliffe, Brisbane (right next to where I am from). 

Sunday, I went to Strasbourg with some of the other exchange students. Strasbourg is a city on the French/German border which has similarities between the French and German cultures. Over the past 200 years, this city has been occupied between France and Germany multiple times. You can really tell this by the architecture in the city, and the cuisine. However, you definitely feel like you are in France, because as soon as you cross the Rhine (which is the border between France and Germany), they start speaking French.

The first thing which we did when we arrived in Strasbourg was to climb the notre dame Cathedral. This church has a spire height of 142m, and is the 6th tallest church in the world, and is the tallest 15th century structure in the world. From the top of the cathedral, you get a full 360-degree view of all of Strasbourg which was really impressive. Not only this, but the inside of the church was extremely beautiful, with a huge astronomical clock in the back right of the church.

After the cathedral, we all walked to petite France, which is a collection of small streets with some traditional French/German buildings. It is known for the cobblestone walkways, canals and half-timber houses. It was a really nice section of Strasbourg and is definitely reminiscent of the two cultures clashing (German and French). Another thing which I mentioned previously which is shared between the two cultures is the cuisine. For lunch, I got a chicken leg in white sauce (very French), with some kÃ¤serspÃ¤tzle (very German).

Stasbourg is also the seat of the European Union Parliament. In the afternoon, we made our way out to the outskirts of the city to see the parliament. As most parliament buildings are, it looked quite modern and there was nothing much to it (another capitol hill in Canberra I would say).

The week finished with the SAP exchange students (myself, EJ and Maddy) visiting the SAP campus for a tour of where we would be working. From Karlsruhe, it is about 1 and a half hours door to door to get to the SAP campus in Walldorf. To make the trip even longer, we decided that we would walk from Walldorf train station to the SAP campus, which ended up being a half an hour walk. Furthermore, we ended up going to the wrong building, instead of going to the reception. 

We managed to find Jayesh eventually, and he showed us to the D-Shop, the place where we will be working next year after our exchange semester. The place had a real start up type vibe, with several interns working on some cool projects all together. The room consisted of what you might expect to see in a startup, a whole bunch of white tables (desks) in the middle of the room, with sticky notes all over the wall. It seemed like a fun place to work in, and I am really excited to start the internship after the Christmas break. Jayesh told us the perks of working with SAP, including free lunch, unlimited coffee and a gym membership, exactly what I want!

And that is it! Besides Maddy, EJ and I laughing about how we nearly missed the bus back to the train station, and the bus driver talking to us in German, that is pretty much it for the rest of the week. Oh, and also, there are these things call ICE trains in Germany (bullet trains). Do not stand close to the platform edge when these things come past, because you will definitely know about it. On the way back home from SAP, I was caught off guard with one of these trains going past the train station at more than 200km/h. Next week, we will be in Slovenia and Italy.
