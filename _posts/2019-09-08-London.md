This post will in no way match the length of my previous post. The reason for this is the time which I spent in London compared to Scotland. I only managed to spend two nights in London (3 days) before I headed over to Karlsruhe, Germany to start the orientation week for university. Although it was a short amount of time, I will do my best to capture the key highlights.

**08/09/19:**
When I first got into London, I only had half a day really to spend doing things. My train left Waverly, Edinburgh at 10am in the morning, and arrived at Kings Cross at 2pm ish in the afternoon. This train ride was quite nice, especially for the first part of the journey due to the scenic Scottish countryside. I have to admit, when I arrived at Kings Cross station, I was a bit disappointed. This is probably due to the fact that I expected the Hogwarts express to be bayed at platform nine and three quarters.

    Although this is not kings cross station, I thought a station photo would go well here.

As soon as I arrived, there came the task of trying to find my way to Chelsea. I would be staying the next two nights at Nicâ€™s (my second cousin) apartment. I opted to take the underground to Westminster. Although this was a good idea at first, I had great difficulty lugging around my 30kg suitcase and 10kg carry on. Not to mention the heat of the underground which I found out the hard way having 3 layers on because I thought London was â€˜going to be coldâ€™.

After arriving at Nicâ€™s, we went out to meet some of her friends at a bar. As it was a Sunday, it would be criminal not to leave the United Kingdom without having a roast. We went and got a Sunday chicken roast for dinner, and it did not disappoint.

**09/09/19:**

This was the only full day which I had in London, so I had to make the most of it. As Georgia was also in London at the same time as me, we both planned to make the most of ticking off monopoly spots. I caught the train in the morning to the east side of the city to tick the first spot off (the tower bridge), albeit itâ€™s not from Monopoly. This was the meeting spot for me to meet Georgia. Georgia came, and we both got Pretâ€™s for breakfast.

Okay, so in my last blog post I promised a lengthy description on Pretâ€™s and Costa, the two best things, besides drum and bass, to come out of the UK. So, what are they? Well they are simply a fast food franchise for cafÃ© food/ready to go food. Think the â€˜food to goâ€™ section at woollies but on steroids. You can get all types of ready to go food (sandwiches, pastries, wraps, salads, fruit, coffee and tea) and its cheap, really cheap. We are talking 2-3 pounds for a sandwich. They are so convenient especially when you are on the go. Okay, a bit side tracked but I owed an explanation to why we need this in Australia. Step up your game woollies. 

Along with the London bridge, there was also the London Palace in the same area. Although I would have loved to have gone inside the palace, we really did not have the time for that this London visit.

We caught the underground to the west side of the city to hit the second spot, Buckingham Palace. When we arrived, there was a fair amount of commotion around the palace. Being intrigued as I always am, I asked a police officer why there was such a large crowd. The reason was the changing of the guard. This is a ritual involving music and bands in which the new guards change out the old guards. It was quite a cool experience to see the guards marching along with the music.

We then went for a walk through the Buckingham gardens to Westminster abbey and the big ben. Of course, as you would expect there was a large number of protestors regarding the Brexit ordeal. We tried to get into Westminster abbey, but the line was too long, and it cost too much money.

We made our way across the other side of the Thames to the London eye. Although the London eye was quite expensive to go on, Georgia and I could not help our self to not go on it whilst we were in London. An in true UK form, the weather was rainy and dark, but it did make for some nice photos at the top of the London eye.

After the London eye it was lunch time and we were both starving. In Australia, we do not have fire guys and fryâ€™s. From YouTube and other forms of pop culture, I have heard all about the fast food chain, and their burgers. When I first arrived in London, I saw the food chain at a train station, and I said to myself that I really wanted to try it before I left London. So, for lunch we got five guys and fryâ€™s to tick another thing off the list. A double cheese bacon burger, with a chocolate thick shake for the biggest feed I have had. It was probably the best beef burger I have had from a fast food place.

I am going to make the rest of the other spots quick, short and sweet. After lunch we went to Piccadilly circus (think UK times square), and Trafalgar square. Two more spots to tick off the monopoly board. We then made a quick pitstop to the M&M store to stock up on some plane snack food.

We caught the train to the other side of the city to the business district. Being from Brisbane, I have always loved the skyline of a city. Most cities in Europe do not have a large skyline because the cities are so old. However, London is one of the exceptions, being a financial centre for the world (much like New York, Sydney or Hong Kong). We went for a walk around the financial district of London, stopping at the Gerkin. We tried to get up to the top of the Gerkin to a bar with little success.

Instead, we opted for a more traditional London bar around the corner. Here we settled down after a day or walking and had a few drinks (with myself spilling one and dropping my camera â€“ thank goodness it didnâ€™t break). Dinner was lebonese with Nic, and then I had to pack my bag to leave the next day for Germany to start orientation week in Karlsruhe!

London was amazing, and I definitely will be back. I saw all of the main places, however I feel like 1 day in London does not do the city justice. The city is so large, so I will need more time to explore different sections (like the nightlife area east of the city)!

Shout out to Nic for your hospitality and a bed when I was in London, you rock!

Next up, Germany.
