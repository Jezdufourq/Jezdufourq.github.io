Welcome to the travelog! Here I will be posting my adventures over the course of the next year, where I will be studying, living and working in Germany. To give some context, I am studying at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences (Karlsruhe, Germany) for one semester, and then completing an internship at SAP (Walldorf, Germany) for a second semester. This whole trip should be wrapped up in August, 2020, where I will return to Brisbane, Australia to complete the rest of my Software Engineering degree. I am excited for the year, and the countless of opportunities it will bring. 
 
Blog posts will be every week (scheduled in for Tuesday at this stage). As I have some content from my previous travels (Scotland, London), I will be uploading some special posts dedicated to covering my experiences there. Furthermore, because it has taken a bit longer then expected to settle into a routine, I have missed two weeks of blog posts (since the start of my exchange). Therefore, I will try and catch up these posts where possible to fill in the missing time.

Excited for everyone to join the adventure!
