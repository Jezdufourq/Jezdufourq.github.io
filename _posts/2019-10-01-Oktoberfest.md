Starting the weekly blogs in Germany with no other than the festival which Germany is known for, Oktoberfest. But before I jump straight into the details of the weekend, I am going to recount some of the events during the week.

The week started with myself organising my university schedule. This was not a typical organisation of a university schedule, whereby you would wait on your laptop for the class registration to open, and then rush to the first available class to make sure that you get the best timetable. Instead, because I am an exchange student, it was much more relaxed. This can be attested to, as 1 month later I would still be sending Class Registration Forms to QUT (I am sorry QUT Study Abroad). I ended up placing into A1.2 German (basically I know nothing). This wasn‚Äôt too bad however, as I ended up finding some tandem partners to help me speak German.

Towards the later end of the week, some of the exchange students (as well as the Australians) went and had a picnic in the park. In Karlsruhe, there is a large garten (garden) around the schloss (castle). When the weather is good, you can find a lot of students, families and couples having picnics in the park, and playing various games such as frisbee, and flunkyball. Our group opted to play frisbee, whilst some of us attempted to build a human pyramid.

Due to some personal events, I had to cancel my Oktoberfest the week before with one of my mates, Trent, from QUT. However, I could not pass up the opportunity to attend the ‚Äòevent‚Äô of Germany. So, in typical exchange student fashion, I booked a last-minute bus and hotel in Munich to stay the Friday night. If I can give you a tip about Oktoberfest, never book accommodation with 4 days of notice. It is extremely expensive, but the experience was worth the money.

So, a 4 hour bus ride later, and I was in the capital of Bayern (Bavaria), M√ºnchen (Munich). I checked into my hotel, and then went for a walk around the center of the city to take in some of the sights. After aimlessly wondering around for 2 hours trying to find and aldi to top up my data, and then using my data to make my way around Munich, I finally found myself in the middle of the city, the marienplatz. For lunch, I tried my first ever bratwurst with mustard. It was amazing, however when I tried to order in German, they spoke in English back to me.

I went back to the hotel, and dressed up in traditional Oktoberfest attire, a lederhosen. I thought that whilst I had some time before I was supposed to meet Trent, that I would walk around and take in the festival before getting written off. Walking around the festival was an experience in itself, so many people dressed up in the traditional Bavarian attire, the smell of cinnamon in the air and roasted nuts. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and got another bratwurst and a huge pretzel (which was not that good in my opinion, but I think that was because it had been sitting out in the cold for a while).

I met Trent at 7:00 ish outside the festival entrance. With two tacked together lederhosens, we walked to the first beer tent we could see to line up and get in. Tip number 2 for Oktoberfest, reserve a table. With the number of tourists and locals that come through the festival each year, you have to reserve a table if you want to stay inside the beer tents. We learnt this the hard way, even though I knew this might be the case with the research that I did prior to the festival. Luckily, we lined up when people were being forced into the beer tents. So, Trent and I made a dash for it. Unluckily (on my part), Trent made it into the tent, and I did not. So, I ended up trying to get into the left side entrance. But this wasn‚Äôt so bad, as I met a girl form London, and an American guy gave me the rest of his beer to skull. Trent ended up coming out of the front of the tent anyway, and we sat on a table outside next to some Americans.

We managed to sneak inside the tent after we grabbed a ma√ü (stein). Inside the tent was crazy, there must have been over 5,000 people dancing on the tables and singing all kinds of German folk songs. The tents themselves were decorated as well, with huge paintings on the walls, and large cloth like material on the ceilings. Too be honest, this is the only thing that I remember much from the tents ‚Äì People signing on tables, and the decorations on the walls. Another thing which some tourists to Oktoberfest do not understand is the white sugar like powder everywhere inside the tents. Most tourists mistake it for something else, but I found out about a month later that it is actually a mint powder to unclog your nose. Another fun fact!

After 3 ma√ü, trent lost his mates (which was his way home), so we had to ditch the tents ASAP. We went outside of the tents, and grabbed currywurst, bratwurst (again) and some roasted macadamias. The food options at Oktoberfest are out of this world. There are so many good options especially after you have had a couple of beers. I did not get around to trying a pork knuckle or a whole chicken (which I do regret a bit), but I can always go back to Munich later. Another fact about the Oktoberfest, the beer is very strong, and you do not realise how much you have drunk until you get home and you are spinning. 

The next day, I woke up had some breakfast at the hotel and then gathered my things. I was supposed to have caught up with Trent again to go into the festival, however his phone was dead (because he camped), and I had no way of contacting him. So I ended up going around Munich to take some more photos of the city. It would not be a trip to Bavaria without trying wei√üwurst (white sausage), sweet mustard and a pretzel. This is a typical Bavarian breakfast and is usually served with a wei√übier (wheat beer). I ended up sitting at a table with two Germans because it was just myself ordering the meal. I wrapped up the day by catching a bus back to Karlsruhe, where the next day (Sunday), I would attend Oktoberfest in Stuttgart.

If the Oktoberfest in Munich was not enough of a German experience, then why not also attend the wasen in Stuttgart. The wasen is exactly the same as Oktoberfest except there are less tourists, the beer is cheaper, more Germans, and more students. So it was only fitting that I attended this event with the rest of the Erasmus (ESN Network) students. We caught a train from Karlsruhe hpf to Stuttgart, where the festival was held. The weather was not that good, as it was cold and wet. However, this was the same weather that we had for Oktoberfest in Munich.

As soon as we got to the wasen, we went and got some currywurst from a food truck (which was surprisingly more expensive then Munich). We then walked around the festival, waiting to line up at 1:30pm for the tent where we would get a free beer on entry. This line was massive, but we were guaranteed a table as soon as we got in. When we got into the tent, it was exactly like the tents in Munich, however there were more students, and it was louder. Also, the beers were so much cheaper compared to Munich. All I remember were the German songs which were being played the whole time we were there. Songs like, ‚ÄúEin Prosit‚Äù, ‚ÄúCordula Gr√ºn‚Äù and ‚ÄúMama Laudaa‚Äù. We ended up getting back to Karlsruhe around 12pm, and I had to walk home in the lederhosen when it was 5 degrees, do not recommend! On Tuesday, I went rock climbing with Johannes, Max and Joschka. It was a really good workout, and I think I will definitely be back to try it again. Wouldn‚Äôt be Germany without a beer after rock climbing.

So, some tips with Oktoberfest.

1. Reserve a table before you go, especially if you are going to Munich
2. Dress up in traditional attire (lederhosen for guys, dirndl for girls)
3. Try some Bavarian food around the feastival
4. Go to the Wasen if you prefer cheaper drinks and a more student vibe
5. Do not book three days before going, you will pay for accommodation!

Cheers Johannes for the lederhosen, I will give it back to you sometime before I go! Next week, Baden-Baden/Black Forest.
